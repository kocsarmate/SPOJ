NOTATIONS

n: the length of the series
a(i): the i-th element (indexed from 1 to n)
r: the ratio
S: the sum of all elements

-----

ASSUMPTIONS

r > 0
a(1) > 0
S + a(n + 1) fits in a 64-bit unsigned integer

-----

Based on the definition of geometric progression:

	a(3) == a(1) * r^2

	a(n - 2) == a(1) * r^(n - 3)

	S == a(1) * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)

The following equation can be derived from theese formulas:

	(a(n - 2) * r^3) + S == (a(3) / r^2) + (S * r)

It is useful, because it contains only r, and known values (a(3), a(n - 2) and S).

-----

ALGORITHM

First, we check if a(3) == a(n - 2). If so, then r == 1, and the problem is trivial. Otherwise, we look for an r
(starting from 2 incrementally), which satisfies the following equation:

	(a(n - 2) * r^3) + S == (a(3) / r^2) + (S * r)

If such r is found, n, and the elements of the series can be easily calculated.

-----

FURTHER IDEAS

A quintic (fifth degree polynomial) equation can be written for r, using a(3), a(n - 2) and S as coefficents:

	(a(n - 2) * r^5) - (S * r^3) + (S * r^2) - a(3) == 0
	
Maybe some solving algorithm could be used to find r more effectively.
